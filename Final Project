My idea for a game:

Cookie Clicker esque game where the more you click, you can gain upgrades to unlock click upgrades.

- Button in the Middle
- Click counter
- Click upgrades (2x, 3x, 4x, auto clicker(?), auto clicker speed increase(?))
- Rebirth System? (Resets all your clicks but with extra benefits)
- Win/Lose: If not at a certain amount of clicks at a certain time you reset to the start? (i dont i have the knowledge to include full levels yet)
